Humans struggle to "see" the structure in functional MRI (BOLD) brain maps. Our goal is to train a GPT that understands brain maps better than humans. This kind of "foundation" model should be useful for things like brain activity encoding and decoding. Plus it will hopefully generate neat fake brain maps.

## Overview

**Datasets.** We train our models using the [NSD-Flat](https://huggingface.co/datasets/clane9/NSD-Flat) Hugging Face dataset, which is derived from the [Natural Scenes Dataset](https://naturalscenesdataset.org/). This is a dataset of paired fMRI BOLD activation maps and natural images from COCO.

**Models.** All our models use a vanilla ViT architecture ([`Transformer`](boldgpt/models/transformer.py)) adapted from [timm](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models/blob/main/timm/models/vision_transformer.py). We consider a few different pre-training objectives:

- Auto-regressive next patch prediction with shuffled patch order ([`ImageGPT`](boldgpt/models/gpt.py)). With either:

  - Discrete k-means token targets ([`KMeansTokenizer`](boldgpt/tokenizer.py)) and cross-entropy loss
  - Continuous patch targets and MSE loss

  The shuffling idea is somewhat new, although see also [SAIM](https://github.com/qiy20/SAIM/tree/main) and [RandSAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12054). Our main innovation compared to these works is the use of a [next position query embedding](boldgpt/models/transformer.py).

- Masked patch prediction following [MAE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae) ([`MAE`](boldgpt/models/mae.py))

**Evaluation.** We are primarily interested in two downstream tasks:

- Image-to-BOLD, i.e. fMRI encoding. See also the [Algonauts 2023 challenge](http://algonauts.csail.mit.edu/).
- BOLD-to-Image, i.e. fMRI image reconstruction. See also [MindEye](https://github.com/MedARC-AI/fMRI-reconstruction-NSD).
